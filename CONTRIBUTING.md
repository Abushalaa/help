# Contributing to Project Jupyter for the First Time

Welcome fellow contributor! We appreciate your help.

We typically label issues appropriate for new contributors as `good first issue` or `help wanted`.  To start an issue, you may comment to let everyone know that you'll be working on it.  Our repos typically provide development installation instructions in each repo's `CONTRIBUTING.md` or `README.md`.  **Should you find an issue with our development installation instructions please let us know in our issues.**  We want to ensure that our documentation for development installation is accurate.  Additionally, other contributors are often available to answer questions about fixing the issue on the issue number or on the repo's gitter channel.

We strive to have a inclusive, welcoming community.  Please read our [code of conduct](https://github.com/jupyter/governance/blob/master/conduct/code_of_conduct.md) to learn more.
